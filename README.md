# Spring Enhancement Framework
For fast using Spring Boot, some common components should be adding first.

By using `spring-boot-starter-web`, here are the components by default:

- Spring Boot
- Logback and Slf4j
- Jackson JSON parser
- StringUtils/MD5 from Spring
- HTTP Request by JDK 11, simply encapsulated

We add some components:

- Obtain Controller Method Name, Request Parameters, and Annotation Information, for debugging more easily
- Global Response Object
- Global Exception Handler
- Spring IoC Tools: DiContextUtil
- Server-side form validation
